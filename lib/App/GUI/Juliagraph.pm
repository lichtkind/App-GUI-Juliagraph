=head1 NAME

App::GUI::Juliagraph - drawing Mandelbrot and Julia fractals

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=over 4

=item 1.

read this POD

=item 2.

start the program (juliagraph)

=item 3.

move knobs and observe how preview sketch reacts til you got
an interesting image

=item 4.

push "Draw" (below drawing board or Ctrl+D or I<Draw> in I<Image> menu)
to produce full resolution image

=item 5.

choose "Save" in Image menu (or Ctrl+S) to store image in a PNG / JPEG / SVG file

=item 6.

choose "Write" in settings menu (Ctrl+W) to save settings into an
INI file for tweaking them later

=back

After first use of the program, a config file I<~/.config/juliagraph> will be
created in you home directory. It contains mainly
stored colors, color sets and dirs where to load and store setting files.
You may also change it by editor or delet it to reset configs to default.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Mandelbrot (first thee) and Julia fractals (second three following) are
just mathematical diagrams, showing you how iterating the equation
C<z_n+1 = z_n ** 2 + C> behaves in the complex plane.
The pixel coordinates are taken as input and the count of iterations it
took to exceed the stop/breakout value decide which color this point will
painted in. In Mandelbrot fraktals the coordinates will be put into the
variable C and in Julia fraktals into the variable z_0
(initial values of the iterator variable).

This program has additional capabilities/options:

=over 4

=item *

choosable exponent above z_n

=item *

a linear part of the term making the formula into: C<z_n+1 = z_n ** EXP + L * z_n + C>

=item *

choosable stop value and stop metric

=item *

free selection of colors

=item *

many option to map th colors onto iteration result values

=head1 GUI


The general layout is very simple: the settings (which define the fractal)
are on the right and the drawing board is left.
The settings are devided into several thematic tabs.

Please mind the tool tips - short help texts which appear if the mouse
stands still over a button. Also helpful are messages in the status bar
at the bottom that appear while browsing the menu.


=head2 Constraints

</p>

The content of the first tab are the settings that define the shape of the fractal.
It also allows you to scroll and zoom into your region of interest.

This page contains 7 complex widgets, which need a little more explanation.
They stretch over a row and have three parts. The leftmost part is a text
field which you could change directly. In cases when pasting or typing
special values into it they may be used, but in most other cases it is
more convenient to use the other parts, since every value change will triger
a new sketch drawing, which is not always fast. On the rightmost is a slider,
which allows you to dial in a value. This value will be added or subtracted
from the value in the textbox if you push the buttons in the middle part.

The first row on this page has two widgets. The first is a radiobox that lets
you choose between Julia and Mandelbrot fraktals. The other is a combobox
that lets you set the exponent in the iteration formula (see L</DESCRIPTION>).
These are the settings that change the shape most fundamentally.

Next are the inputs for the values A and B these are the real and imaginary
parts of a complex constant. In a Julia fraktal this constant is added
after each iteration. In the Mandelbrot fractal it will provide the starting
value of Z.

Below that are the values C and D, which are real and imaginary parts of
a factor. During each iteration the product of this factor with the iterator
variable z will be added like the constant.

Below further are the X and Y coordinates of the center of the image.
Changing these will move the visible part of the fractal left/right
or down/up. Please note that these values are relative and if you zoom
in, they will be become smaller.

The second lowest input is the zoom factor.
It is greater the more you zoom in.

The lowest row contains two choices. First the stop value. If the iteration
variable has a greater value than it - the iteration stops. Because we
compare an complex iteration value with a real number, we compute the
absolute value of the iteration variable (displayed by C<|var|>). But
other metrics are possible. Just keep in mind x is the real part of the
iteration variable Z and y is the imaginary part.

On the second tab we have three rows of settings which determine how the
selected colors will be applied.

The first checkbox selects if we use the colors at all or just the
default grey gradient. The combobox in the first row let you pick how many
of the selected colors will be used. If you choose for instance 6, the
first six (1..6) are used to display the fraktal, plus of course black
as the background color for the area where the iteration variable never
reaches the stop value. Never in this context mean the maximum available
amunt of iterations as computed by the product of the numbers shown on
this page except I<Dynamics>.

The second row defines how we proceed from one color to the next.
If for instance I<Gradient> set to 5, there will be 5 additional colors
between each of the selected colors, to make the transition smoother.
If I<Dynamics> is set to 0, this transition will be linear. Otherwise
it will tilt into one or the other side.

The third row has two more settings which will influence the shape
of these gradients. By setting the I<Grouping> value higher than 1
you stretch the gradient by a factor. If for instance I<Grouping> is set
to three, three neighbouring areas which normally would have three different
colors will have the same color and just the next, forth area will contain
the next color. The I<Repeat> value also multiplies the number of used
colors. As soon the painter runs out of colors it will take the first again
and repeat this process the ordered amount of times.

=head2 Colors

=for HTML <p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lichtkind/App-GUI-Juliagraph/master/img/POD/Color.png"    alt=""  width="630" height="410">
</p>

This page helps you to select the color that will be used to paint the fractal.
Only the background color is currently fixed to black. You can see these
colors in the middle section named "Currently Used State Colors".
If you click on one - it will be selected which you can see from_rgbthe
arrow below the selected color.

In the section below named "Selected State Color" you see the values
in RGB space and HSL space of the selected color. Yan change any of them
directly by slider, typing them in or pressing the plus and minus buttons.

The "Color Store" in the last row allows you store the selected color for
later reuse (just press save and type in its name). With the combo box or
the arrow buttons you can also select there a color and press load to
chhose it as the new currently selected color. Press there Del(ete) to
delete the visible color from the store.

Analogues to that there is a color set store in the first row of this
page which enables you to store and load all currently used colors at once.
Please use there the I<New> button to create a new color set to avoid
overwriting the currently seleced color set, when pressing I<Save>.

The second row contains some color set functions to create gradients between
the leftmost and selected color or to compute colors that are complementary
to the selected.


=head2 Menu

The upmost menu bar has only three very simple menus.
Please not that each menu shows which key combination triggers the same
command and while hovering over an menu item you see a short help text
the left status bar field.

The first menu is for loading and storing setting files with arbitrary
names. Also a sub menu allows a quick load of the recently used files.
The first entry lets you reset the whole program to the starting state
and the last is just to exit (safely with saving the configs).

The second menu has only two commands for drawing an complete image
and saving it in an arbitrary named PNG, JPG or SVG file (the file ending decides).
The submenu above onle set the preferred format, which is the format
of serial images and the first wild card in dialog. Above that is another
submenu for setting the image size.

The third menu has only a dialog with some additional information of version numbers and our homepage.
